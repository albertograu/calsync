Race Condition Fix Summary - Long-term Solution Implementation

This script summarizes the comprehensive race condition fixes implemented
in the sync engine to prevent timing issues that caused bidirectional sync failures.

PROBLEM SOLVED:
- Two-phase sync token implementation wasn't capturing tokens at the right time
- Events created during sync processing were missed by next incremental sync
- No automatic detection or recovery from race conditions
- Manual intervention required to fix sync token timing issues

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. True post-processing token capture AFTER all sync operations complete
2. Automatic race condition detection via token comparison and event verification  
3. Intelligent recovery that clears tokens to force full sync when needed
4. Comprehensive fallback detection for incomplete incremental syncs
5. Extensive logging and monitoring for troubleshooting
